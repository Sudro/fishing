    <h2 id="guide">Fishing guide</h2>
    <p>First of all, you need to remove the fishing rod from your inventory, then attach the bait, which is divided into two categories: float and bait.</p>
    <p>Press LT to pick up the fishing rod and then RT to cast the bait. The longer you hold RT, the further the line will fly. It is better to cast the bait where you have planned, so do not hesitate to make several casts.
Now everything depends on your bait and all that remains is to sit and wait for the fish to be hooked.</p>
    <p>You can attract the attention of the fish by pressing RT. This will be effective if you are close enough to the shore or can even see fish in the water. But don't do it too often or too much - it will scare her away.</p>
    <p>You should not reel in the fishing rod until you feel that the fish is on the hook. The idea is that the fish first bites the bait several times and then swallows it whole, biting the hook. As soon as this happens, you will see that the float has gone down and the line has begun to unwind.</p>
    <p>All you have to do is move the fishing rod or start reeling it in and the fish will vigorously resist. You will feel the line being stretched. The intensity of the fish's resistance can be determined by the degree of bending of the fishing rod - the more, the stronger the fish. Take your time, wait until the fish gets tired - then the tension in the fishing line and the degree of bending of the fishing rod will decrease. If you start reeling ahead of time, the line will burst or the fishing rod will break. If necessary, release the line.</p>
    <p>To make the fish tire faster, you can move the left stick in the opposite direction. You can also click the right stick and move it in any direction to prevent the fish from picking up more line. You should be careful here - you can easily break your fishing line. It can also tear if it touches a rock or any object between you and the fish.</p>
    <p>You reel in the line and reel in the fish by twisting the right stick counterclockwise. Always consider three factors - whether the fish is tired, how much line you have already released, how tight it is and where the fish is. Pushing the left stick down while rotating the right stick greatly speeds up the process and brings the fish right into your hands.</p>
    <p>To make fishing go faster, it is better to cast the bait when you see fish. Throw the bait directly in front of it and slowly reel in the line so that the fish can see it. Well, if you lose the battle, don’t be upset - the lakes, rivers and swamps are full of different living creatures.</p>

    <h2 id="tips">Useful tips</h2>
    <p>Choose the right time to fish: If you want to be successful in fishing, you also need to consider the time of day. The best bite is observed in the early morning and afternoon before lunch, as bugs fly above the surface of the water. The fish's attention is also drawn to rain because it thinks it's bugs falling - use this for fishing.</p>
    <p>Beware of wild goats: In some areas there are wild goats that can interfere with fishing. There were cases when goats attacked from behind and broke fishing rods.</p>
    <p>Fish from a boat: By boat you can sail from the shore, where there are usually larger fish than near the shore.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="baits">Types of baits</h2>
    <p>Just like in real life, the right bait is crucial in fishing, especially if you want to catch a big fish. For small and medium fish you need to purchase the main components - bread, corn and cheese; to catch large fish you need to spend more money buying worms and crustaceans.</p>
    <p>On sale you can also find baits specific to certain rivers, lakes and swamps, as well as special baits that are useful for catching the largest or legendary fish. The bait consists of a float and bait.</p>
    <p>Float:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bread, corn and cheese are good for catching small fish;</li>
       <li>Worms are excellent for luring medium-sized lake fish;</li>
       <li>Crustaceans are good at attracting larger fish that live in the deep parts of rivers and lakes;</li>
       <li>Crickets are great for attracting medium-sized river fish.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bait:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For rivers: attracts all small and medium-sized fish that live in any rivers;</li>
      <li>For the lake: attracts large fish that live in lakes;</li>
      <li>For swamps: attracts swamp inhabitants and large fish;</li>
