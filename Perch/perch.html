    <p class="text-content">Perch are widespread in rivers and lakes throughout the land. Small but tasty, they swim near the surface to feed on algae and water plants and will take a variety of food baits, particularly bread. Sunny weather, when they are at their most active, is best for Perch fishing. There are rumors of a Legendary Perch somewhere in the Roanoke Ridge region.</p>
